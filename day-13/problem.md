# Day 13 — 2621. Sleep

## Problem
Given a positive integer `millis`, write an asynchronous function that sleeps for `millis` milliseconds and then resolves.

Minor deviation from the exact time is acceptable.

## Examples

### Example 1
Input: millis = 100  
Output: resolves after ~100ms

### Example 2
Input: millis = 200  
Output: resolves after ~200ms

## Constraints
- 1 <= millis <= 1000
